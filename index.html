            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>Beacon enables the best possible research into catastrophic and existential risk. We provide fiscal sponsorship, administrative and management overhead, and compliance infrastructure so researchers can focus on the work that matters.</p>
            <p>We are relentlessly focused on catastrophic and existential risk, with a deep understanding of the funding and research ecosystem around it. We know what researchers and project directors need, and we want to give it to them and get out of the way.</p>

            <h2>Why Beacon</h2>
            <p>Researchers working on catastrophic risk need to move fast and build things inside a well-governed environment. Traditional fiscal sponsors are too slow, too restrictive on intellectual property, and lack the domain understanding to serve this work well.</p>
            <p>Beacon exists because the people working on the hardest problems facing humanity deserve infrastructure that understands the urgency and gets out of their way.</p>
