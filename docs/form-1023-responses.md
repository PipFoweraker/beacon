## Part VIII — Specific Activities

### Question 7: Do you or will you provide goods, services, or funds to individuals?

**Lawyer marked: Yes**

This is correct. Beacon's fiscal sponsorship model involves disbursing funds to and on behalf of individual project leads, paying contractors engaged by sponsored projects, and providing compliance and administrative services to project personnel.

> **Suggested response:** Beacon provides fiscal sponsorship services to individuals leading projects that address global catastrophic risk. This includes: (1) receiving and administering restricted charitable funds on behalf of sponsored projects; (2) disbursing approved project expenses including personnel costs, contractor payments, and operational expenses; (3) providing compliance support, financial reporting, and governance guidance to project leads. All disbursements are governed by written fiscal sponsorship agreements that require funds be used exclusively for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes consistent with Section 501(c)(3). Beacon does not provide unrestricted funds to individuals.

---

### Question 9: Do you or will you make grants, loans, or other distributions to organizations?

**Lawyer marked: Yes (all sub-questions 9a through 9i except 9f)**

This is the heart of fiscal sponsorship. Beacon receives grants from philanthropic funders and administers them on behalf of sponsored projects. Some sponsored projects may themselves be organizations (e.g., unincorporated research groups, foreign entities). Beacon may also make re-grants to established 501(c)(3) organizations pursuing GCR work.

#### 9a: Do you maintain records to substantiate the amount of grants or assistance?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon maintains complete financial records for all grants received and disbursed, including: grant agreements, donor correspondence, disbursement requests, receipts, and financial reports. All records are retained for a minimum of seven years consistent with IRS requirements for tax-exempt organizations.

#### 9b: Do you or will you verify that grant recipients are not on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Prior to disbursing funds to any individual or organization, Beacon screens all recipients against the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list and other applicable sanctions lists. This screening is repeated periodically for ongoing relationships.

#### 9c: Do you or will you make pre-grant inquiries about the recipient?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon conducts due diligence on all prospective sponsored projects before entering into fiscal sponsorship agreements. This includes: (1) reviewing the project's alignment with Beacon's charitable mission of reducing global catastrophic risk; (2) assessing the project lead's qualifications and track record; (3) evaluating the proposed budget and use of funds for consistency with 501(c)(3) purposes; (4) verifying the identity and background of key project personnel. For projects receiving pass-through grants from institutional funders, Beacon also considers the funder's own due diligence as a supplementary input, while maintaining independent evaluation responsibility.

#### 9d: Do you or will you use a grant agreement that specifies the terms and conditions?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. All fiscal sponsorship relationships are governed by written agreements that specify: the scope of the sponsored project, permitted uses of funds, reporting obligations, intellectual property arrangements, termination conditions, and the requirement that all activities be conducted exclusively for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3). For re-grants to other organizations, Beacon uses grant agreements that include expenditure responsibility provisions where applicable.

#### 9e: Do you or will you monitor the use of funds?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon monitors the use of funds through: (1) requiring periodic financial and narrative reports from sponsored projects (quarterly at minimum); (2) reviewing disbursement requests against approved project budgets before releasing funds; (3) conducting periodic reviews of project activities for continued alignment with charitable purposes and the approved project scope; (4) retaining the right to suspend or terminate funding if funds are not used in accordance with the fiscal sponsorship agreement. The board of directors reviews a summary of all active sponsorships at regular board meetings.

#### 9g: Do you or will you make grants to individuals?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon disburses funds to individuals in two contexts: (1) as project leads receiving compensation for work on sponsored GCR projects, where compensation has been approved as part of the project budget and fiscal sponsorship agreement; and (2) as contractors or consultants engaged by sponsored projects for specific deliverables. All payments to individuals are made pursuant to written agreements, are reviewed for reasonableness, and are reported on applicable IRS information returns (Form W-2 or 1099 as appropriate).

#### 9h: Do you or will you make grants to foreign individuals or organizations?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Some GCR projects may involve researchers, institutions, or activities located outside the United States. Beacon may disburse funds internationally where: (1) the funded activity furthers Beacon's exempt purposes; (2) the recipient has been screened against applicable sanctions lists; (3) Beacon exercises expenditure responsibility over the grant or, for grants to foreign equivalents of 501(c)(3) organizations, has obtained a good faith determination of the recipient's equivalency status. Beacon will comply with all IRS requirements for grants to foreign organizations and individuals, including those set out in Revenue Procedure 92-94 and Treasury Regulation § 53.4945-5.

#### 9i: Do you have written policies and procedures for monitoring grants?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon's grant monitoring policies include: (1) standardised reporting templates and schedules; (2) financial review procedures for all disbursement requests; (3) criteria for escalation and remediation when project activities diverge from the approved scope; (4) procedures for grant closeout and final reporting; and (5) document retention requirements. These policies are approved by the board of directors and reviewed annually.

### Question 10: Do you or will you operate in a foreign country or have activities outside the United States?

**Lawyer marked: Yes (10a, 10b, 10c)**

**[FLAG FOR DISCUSSION]:** This depends on how "operate in a foreign country" is interpreted. Beacon is a US entity. It will not have offices, employees, or physical operations in foreign countries. However, it may sponsor projects whose work occurs partly or wholly outside the US (e.g., a biosecurity researcher based in the UK, a policy project engaging with international institutions). It may also have a founder/CEO based in Australia.

If "operate" means "have activities or disburse funds internationally," then Yes is correct. If it means "have a physical presence or establishment," the answer might be No with a narrative explanation. **Recommend confirming interpretation with attorney.**

#### 10a: Name the foreign countries and regions

> **Suggested response:** Beacon does not maintain offices or permanent operations in any foreign country. However, sponsored projects may conduct activities in various countries depending on the nature of the GCR work. The organization's founder is based in Australia. Beacon anticipates that project activities may occur in the United Kingdom, European Union member states, and Australia, among other jurisdictions, depending on the projects accepted for sponsorship.

#### 10b: Describe the activities in each foreign country

> **Suggested response:** Beacon's international activities are limited to: (1) disbursing funds to or on behalf of sponsored projects whose research, policy, or field-building work may take place outside the United States; (2) administrative coordination with project leads who may be located internationally. Beacon does not directly operate programs in foreign countries. All international disbursements are subject to the same monitoring and expenditure responsibility requirements as domestic disbursements.

#### 10c: Describe how you ensure foreign activities further your exempt purposes

> **Suggested response:** Beacon ensures foreign-directed activities further its exempt purposes through the same mechanisms applied to all sponsored projects: (1) initial due diligence confirming the project's alignment with GCR risk reduction; (2) written fiscal sponsorship agreements requiring all funded activities serve charitable, educational, or scientific purposes; (3) ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements; (4) expenditure responsibility for grants to foreign organizations; and (5) OFAC and sanctions screening for all foreign recipients. The board of directors reviews international activities as part of its regular oversight of the sponsorship portfolio.

## Part V — Compensation and Other Financial Arrangements

### Question 1: Compensation arrangements

**Lawyer marked: Yes for 1a through 1g**

#### 1a: Do you or will you compensate officers, directors, trustees, or key employees?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. The CEO/Executive Director (Pip Foweraker) receives annual compensation of $120,000 for approximately 0.8 FTE. No other officers or directors currently receive compensation. Directors serve on a volunteer basis. As the organization grows, Beacon anticipates hiring additional staff, with compensation determined through the process described below.

#### 1b: Do you or will you compensate the highest compensated employees with compensation of more than $50,000?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. The CEO/Executive Director is currently the only employee compensated above $50,000. Compensation was established by reference to comparable positions at similarly situated 501(c)(3) organizations in the fiscal sponsorship and GCR/EA nonprofit space, including [reference specific comparables if available — e.g., Survival and Flourishing Fund, Centre for Effective Altruism, fiscal sponsors of comparable scale].

#### 1c: Do you or will you compensate independent contractors with compensation of more than $50,000?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon anticipates engaging independent contractors for specialised services including legal counsel, accounting, and potentially technical consulting related to project due diligence. Contractor compensation is set by reference to market rates and is approved by the CEO or, for engagements exceeding [threshold], by the board.

#### 1d: Do you or will you have policies or procedures for compensation review?

[NOTE: This sub-question may be worded differently on the form — verify]

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon's compensation review process includes: (1) initial compensation for the CEO was established by benchmarking against comparable roles at similarly situated 501(c)(3) organizations and was included in the funding proposal reviewed by the initial grantor (AISTOF); (2) the board of directors will review CEO compensation annually, using current comparability data from similar organizations; (3) all compensation decisions are made by individuals who do not have a conflict of interest with respect to the compensation arrangement being reviewed; (4) the board documents the basis for its compensation decisions, including the comparability data reviewed and the reasoning for the approved amount.

#### 1e: Do you or will you use comparability data to determine compensation?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. CEO compensation was initially set by reference to salaries at comparable nonprofit organizations, including fiscal sponsors and GCR-focused nonprofits of similar budget size and staff complement. The board will continue to use comparability data, including publicly available Form 990 data from peer organizations, to review and set compensation levels.

#### 1f: Do you have a conflict of interest policy?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. Beacon has adopted a conflict of interest policy that applies to all directors, officers, and key employees. The policy requires disclosure of actual or potential conflicts, recusal from decision-making where conflicts exist, and documentation of how conflicts are managed. The policy is based on the sample conflict of interest policy in IRS Form 1023 Appendix A. [Attach policy as exhibit]

#### 1g: Do you or will you approve compensation based on the review of comparables?

> **Suggested response:** Yes. See responses to 1d and 1e above. All compensation decisions are informed by comparability data and documented accordingly.

### Question 2: Financial arrangements with interested persons

**Lawyer marked: Yes**

This covers the Certes secondment arrangement and any other financial relationships between Beacon and its officers/directors or related entities.

> **Suggested response:** Yes. The CEO/Executive Director of Beacon also serves as Executive Director of Certes Institute, a related entity. [Describe the specific nature of any financial arrangement — e.g.: "Beacon's initial operations are supported by a grant from AISTOF. The CEO's time is allocated approximately 0.8 FTE to Beacon. There are no loans, leases, or shared-revenue arrangements between Beacon and Certes. The board of directors is aware of the dual role and has determined that it does not constitute a conflict that would impair Beacon's ability to operate exclusively for exempt purposes, subject to the conflict of interest policy described above."]
>
> **[PIP: You should specify here exactly what the Certes-Beacon financial relationship looks like. Is Certes paying Pip who then works for Beacon? Is AISTOF paying Beacon who pays Pip? Is there a secondment agreement? The IRS will want to understand the money flow.]**

---

### Question 3: Performance-based compensation, bonuses, or similar arrangements

**Lawyer marked: Yes**

**[FLAG — DISCUSS WITH ATTORNEY]**

Based on Pip's input: There are **no ongoing bonuses or performance-based compensation** planned for the CEO or any other position. However, there are two specific financial events that may trigger this "yes":

1. **Retroactive lump sum for pre-formation work:** Pip performed substantial work prior to Beacon's incorporation (business planning, governance design, legal and accounting coordination, fundraising) and incurred out-of-pocket expenses (attorney fees, accounting fees, etc.) that could not be reimbursed until a legal entity existed to receive funding.

2. **Expense reimbursement for pre-formation costs:** Direct out-of-pocket expenses (legal, accounting, registration fees) paid personally before the entity could receive funds.

**My recommendation: Yes, this should be highlighted and explained clearly.** The IRS is specifically looking for arrangements that could constitute private inurement or excessive benefit. A well-documented, board-approved retroactive payment for legitimate pre-formation work is a normal and accepted practice for nonprofit startups — but only if:
- The amount is reasonable and documented
- The board reviews and approves it at arm's length (meaning Pip recuses from the vote)
- There's an itemised record of work performed and expenses incurred
- It's a one-time arrangement, not a recurring structure

Trying to minimise or obscure this would be worse than disclosing it clearly.

> **Suggested response:** Beacon does not maintain any ongoing performance-based compensation, bonus, or incentive compensation arrangements. However, the board of directors has approved [or: will consider approving] a one-time payment to the founder/CEO for: (1) pre-formation services rendered prior to incorporation, including business planning, governance development, fundraising, and coordination with legal counsel and accountants over a period of approximately [X months]; and (2) reimbursement of documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the organization prior to its formation, including legal fees, accounting fees, and [other specific costs].
>
> This arrangement was [will be] reviewed and approved by the board of directors, with the interested party (the CEO) recused from the vote. The total amount of $[amount] was determined by reference to: (a) the CEO's standard compensation rate for the period of pre-formation work; and (b) documented receipts for out-of-pocket expenses. This is a one-time arrangement; no future performance-based compensation is contemplated.
>
> **[PIP: Fill in the specific amounts, time period, and itemise the major expense categories. The more specific and documented this is, the better it reads to the IRS.]**

## Notes for Attorney Review

1. **Q10 (foreign operations):** The "yes" answer needs clarification. Beacon doesn't operate abroad, but sponsors projects that may work internationally. The distinction between "operating" and "funding activities" matters here. Recommend discussing whether a "No with explanation" is more appropriate than "Yes."

2. **Q3 (compensation — lump sum):** This is the item most likely to draw IRS follow-up. Recommend preparing a detailed exhibit documenting: pre-formation timeline, work performed, expenses incurred, and board resolution approving the payment. The fact that the initial funder (AISTOF) was aware of and approved the arrangement in the original grant is helpful context if true.

3. **Q9 series (grants/distributions):** The "yes" answers are all correct for a fiscal sponsor. The responses above emphasise Beacon's independent due diligence rather than relying solely on funders' due diligence. This is important — the IRS wants to see that Beacon exercises its own judgment, not that it's a pass-through. The suggested language acknowledges that institutional funders have done their own diligence (which is true and relevant) while making clear Beacon maintains its own evaluation process.

4. **Comparables for CEO comp:** The $120k/0.8 FTE figure should be supported by specific comparable data. Recommend pulling 3-5 Form 990 salary disclosures from peer organizations (fiscal sponsors of similar scale, GCR/EA nonprofits). These are publicly available via ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer.
