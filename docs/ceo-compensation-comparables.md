### Fiscal Sponsors and Grantmaking Organizations

| Organization | Person | Title | Compensation | Revenue | FY | Source |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|-----|--------|
| Ashgro Inc | Jason Hepburn | President/CEO | $0 | $2.1M | 2023 | [Form 990](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/884232889) |
| Ashgro Inc | Rachel Williams | COO | $42,307 | $2.1M | 2023 | Same filing |
| NEO Philanthropy | Michele Lord | President | $323,627 | $168.9M | 2024 | [Form 990](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/133191113) |
| Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors | Latanya Mapp | President/CEO | $688,313 | $706M | 2024 | [Form 990](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/133615533) |

**Note on Ashgro:** CEO compensation is $0 in FY2023. This likely reflects a startup-phase arrangement where the founder is not yet drawing salary, which is common for early-stage nonprofits. Ashgro's total salaries and wages were $145,393 on $2.1M revenue. Beacon's proposed CEO compensation of $120,000 on comparable revenue is consistent with this range.

## Summary Statistics — AI Safety / GCR CEO/ED Compensation (US 501(c)(3))

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Number of comparables | 8 CEO/ED roles |
| Median | ~$220,000 |
| Mean | ~$254,000 |
| Range | $143,628 – $424,805 |
| 25th percentile | ~$175,000 |
| Beacon proposed (FTE-adjusted) | $150,000 |
| Beacon proposed (actual, 0.8 FTE) | $120,000 |

**Beacon's proposed compensation falls below the 25th percentile of comparable CEO/ED roles at US 501(c)(3) organizations in the AI safety and global catastrophic risk space.** The actual compensation of $120,000 (reflecting 0.8 FTE) is lower than any CEO/ED compensation in the comparable set.

## Size-Adjusted Comparison

Beacon's Year 1 operating revenue (~$662k) is smaller than most comparables above. The closest size-matched comparables are:

| Organization | Revenue | CEO/ED Comp | Comp as % of Revenue |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------------|
| MIRI (FY2024) | $1.5M | $241,531 (CEO) | 16.1% |
| Ashgro (FY2023) | $2.1M | $0 (CEO) + $145k (total wages) | 6.9% |
| FAR AI (FY2023) | ~$3.5M | $143,628 (CEO) | 4.1% |
| **Beacon (projected)** | **$0.66M** | **$120,000** | **18.1%** |

Beacon's CEO compensation as a percentage of operating revenue is higher than the larger comparables, which is expected for a startup-phase organization — fixed leadership costs represent a larger share of revenue before the organization scales. The percentage is comparable to MIRI's ratio, which operates at roughly 2x Beacon's revenue. As Beacon's sponsorship portfolio grows, this ratio will decrease.

## Additional Context — International Market Data

The CEO is based in Australia. While Australian salary data is not directly relevant to IRS comparability analysis, it provides context for the reasonableness of the arrangement:

| Benchmark | AUD | USD Equivalent |
|-----------|-----|---------------|
| Australian Public Service EL2.4 (top step) | $186,140 | ~$121,000 |
| Australian NFP CEO (all-sector average) | $145,136 | ~$94,000 |
| ANU Associate Professor (Level D1) | $170,227 | ~$111,000 |

The proposed compensation of USD $120,000 (0.8 FTE) is consistent with mid-to-senior Australian public sector and academic benchmarks, reflecting the founder's opportunity cost.

## Methodology

1. **Comparable selection criteria:** US-based 501(c)(3) organizations operating in AI safety, existential risk, effective altruism, or fiscal sponsorship/grantmaking. Preference given to organizations of similar scale (under $10M revenue) and mission focus.

2. **Data source:** IRS Form 990 filings accessed via [ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/). All figures represent the most recent publicly available filing as of February 2026.

3. **Compensation figures:** Total reported compensation from Form 990, Part VII. Includes base salary and reportable compensation; does not include estimated amounts of other compensation from the organization and related organizations unless noted.

4. **Exchange rates:** AUD/USD conversions use approximate rate of 0.65 (as of early 2026).

---

## Conclusion

The proposed CEO compensation of $120,000 (0.8 FTE) is conservative relative to the comparable set:

- It is **below the lowest full-time CEO/ED salary** in the AI safety nonprofit comparable set ($143,628, FAR AI)
- The full-time equivalent ($150,000) remains **below the 25th percentile** of comparable roles
- It is consistent with **Australian public sector senior executive benchmarks**, reflecting the founder's alternative employment options
- The arrangement was included in the funding proposal reviewed and approved by the organization's initial institutional funder (AISTOF)

The board of directors will review CEO compensation annually using updated comparability data, with the CEO recused from the review process.
