# Beacon Domain Notes

## Domain Search (2026-01-19)

### Checked Domains

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| beaconfiscal.org | Available | Descriptive, matches foundational doc example |
| beaconops.org | Available | Shorter, but less specific |
| joinbeacon.org | Available | Rejected — "join" implies open scaling; Beacon caps at ~30-40 projects |

### Recommendation

**beacongcr.org** — pivoted from beaconfiscal.org to reflect broader GCR mission. .org appropriate for 501(c)(3).

**Note (2026-02):** Domain changed from beaconfiscal.org to beacongcr.org. Email will move to pip@beacongcr.org. Update Google Workspace, Dreamhost panel, and GitHub secrets accordingly.
