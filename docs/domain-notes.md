# Beacon Domain Notes

## Domain Search (2026-01-19)

### Checked Domains

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| beaconfiscal.org | Available | Descriptive, matches foundational doc example |
| beaconops.org | Available | Shorter, but less specific |
| joinbeacon.org | Available | Rejected — "join" implies open scaling; Beacon caps at ~30-40 projects |

### Recommendation

**beaconfiscal.org** — clearly communicates fiscal sponsorship purpose, .org appropriate for 501(c)(3).

### Registration

- [ ] Register chosen domain
